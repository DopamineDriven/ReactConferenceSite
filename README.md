## Using React Hooks to declaratively create functionality
    - Using hooks replaces a lot of "ceremony"
    - React class components had to be used pre-Hooks
    - Hooks allows the use of functional components
    - Less is more
    - Hooks/Functional components = a better React paradigm

### Initial Content Setup Source
- Peter Kellner's React Hooks course on pluralsight.com

## Pages
- Two pages
    - index.jsx
    - speakers.jsx
- These pages call common App.jsx functional component that handles the routing to go between the pages. 

## React v16.3.0 March 29, 2018
- React team shipped new Context API to make accessing data very simple and straightforward
    - without this, prop drilling and HOCs were prevalent (ugly)
    - useContext Hook allows one to access data in any functional components without any unnatural acts
    - Creating wrapping tags in render events that have nothing to do with the UI become obsolete 
    - storing configurational information in your app and having it available in any functional component you want
